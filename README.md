# OneCard-Dashboard
Displays UVic OneCard data nicely with some added data visualization.

## Usage
This project is not meant for the general uvic student base at this time as we are in beta testing.
please contact us if you wish to join the beta.

## How We Do It
Our site sends your username and password to uvic if the request is succesful we ask uvic for their
webpage with your ONECard Data on it. We take that page and make it look prettier
before sending it back to you. Usernames and passwords are never stored they are sent directly to uvic
(they are sent to the same place the uvic login sites sends them).
If you reload the page you will automatically be logged in again, we reccomend not reloading the page
too frequently as it risks your account being flagged for suspicous activity.
If you have security concerns please contact us.
